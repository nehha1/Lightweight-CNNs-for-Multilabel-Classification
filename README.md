# Lightweight-CNNs-for-Multilabel-Classification
This project involves developing a lightweight CNN for multilabel classification of clinical medical imaging.Our model is a custom lightweight CNN developed from transfer learning by using pre-trained lightweight object detection models like MobileNet V2 and EfficientNet B0, both of which use less than 4 million parameters. Unlike conventional deep architectures such as VGG-16 or ResNet-50, which use over 100 million parameters, our lightweight CNN aims to reduce computational complexity while maintaining competitive performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. To address the inherent class imbalance and multi-label nature of the dataset, we integrate a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function, where class-wise positive and negative weights are derived from label frequency distributions. This loss formulation ensures improved sensitivity to rare pathologies, which are underrepresented in the dataset. Our model has been developed with minimal hardware resources and hence can be further optimized for scalability and deployment on edge devices, making it suitable for point-of-care diagnostics in real-world clinical environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves competitive performance with less than 2.5 million trainable parameters. This makes it highly relevant for automated radiology workflows, where real-time decision-making is essential.
